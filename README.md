# Welcome to, CSS Snackables

## What??

CSS Snackables is a weekly-ish Youtube series where we take a Dribbble design and code it with CSS, HTML, & JS. Each video is around 40-45minutes in length with the code hosted here on Github and a demo on CodePen.

I hope you enjoy. 

*PS: feel free to submit PRs to improve the code*
